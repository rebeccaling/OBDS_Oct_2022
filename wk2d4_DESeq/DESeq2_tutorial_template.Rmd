# install packages 

- If i didn't already have these installed in my environment - I would delete the # on lines 19-23 and 26-39 and run the code 

```{r}
# from cran - this is what to run if I wish to load the packages myself
# install.packages('tidyverse')
# install.packages("RColorBrewer")
# install.packages('pheatmap')
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#    install.packages("BiocManager")

# from bioconductor
# BiocManager::install("ashr")
# BiocManager::install("apeglm")
# BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
# BiocManager::install("org.Mm.eg.db")
```

# load packages

- what do these packages do? Add comments to remind you what they do 
```{r}
library("pheatmap")   #pretty heatmap plotting

# 1 Prepping our input data to make deseq2dataset object

## Import counts table

- We made this (or a very similar version) using featurecounts in week1 on the cluster
- raw data -> fastqc -> hisat2 -> featurecounts 

```{r}
# Import counts data to variable called featurecounts_table
# The file has a comment line we need to ignore at top of file 
featurecounts_table <- read_tsv("/t1-data/project/obds/shared/resources/3_r_stats_genomics/rnaseq_differential_expression/allsamples_counts.tsv.gz", comment = "#")
head(featurecounts_table)

# lets save the gene info (Chr,Start,End,Strand, Length) columns as a seperate dataframe (df) incase we need it later
# call this table gene_info and set row names as Geneid
gene_info <- featurecounts_table %>%
                column_to_rownames("Geneid") %>%                     
                dplyr::select(Chr, Start, End, Strand, Length)
head(gene_info)
#this changes the Geneid column to the row, and copies the chr, start, end, strand and length into a separate dataframe called gene_info.


# create a counts table without the gene info (Chr,Start,End,Strand, Length) columns
# to get a clean counts table where:
# rows = genename, columns = samples
counts_table <- featurecounts_table %>%
                  column_to_rownames("Geneid") %>%
                  dplyr::select(!c(Chr, Start, End, Strand, Length)) %>%
                  as.matrix()

head(counts_table)

# check the dimensions of this counts_table table using dim() -> should have 39,179 genes and 8 cols 
dim(counts_table)

```

# Right now lets import and set up our table of sample information

```{r}
sample_info <- read_tsv("/t1-data/project/obds/shared/resources/3_r_stats_genomics/rnaseq_differential_expression/PRJEB18572_sample_info.tsv")
sample_info

# What class is the cell_type currently? 
class(sample_info$cell_type)


# We want to change it to a factor with 2 levels (the hypothesis we will test)
# Which should be our reference level? 

sample_info$cell_type <- factor(sample_info$cell_type, levels = c('CD4', 'CD8'))
tail(sample_info)

# what other columns might we want to include in our design that we want to change to factors? genotype and replicate 
#can use as.factor if do not wish to specify levels (can also use factor(), without specifying levels). Use factor() if wish to specify the levels. 

sample_info$genotype <- as.factor(sample_info$genotype)

sample_info$replicate <- factor(sample_info$replicate, levels = c('1', '2', '3'))

head(sample_info)

```

# Check the sample names are the same and in the same order in the sample_info and counts_table 

```{r}
# Column names of the count table and row names of the sample info table must be in the same order
# Check this 
colnames(counts_table) == rownames(sample_info)
head(sample_info)

# make sample_info row names from sample_id - currently sample_info is a tibble and so doesn't like having rownames. Need to change to a dataframe first and then change sample_id to rowname from a column.
sample_info <- sample_info %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
  column_to_rownames('sample_id')
class(sample_info)
head(sample_info)

colnames(counts_table) == rownames(sample_info)

# remove .bam from colnames of the counts table. Select vector, then pattern to select, then the replacement for that
colnames(counts_table) <- str_replace(colnames(counts_table), ".bam", "")
head(counts_table)

colnames(counts_table) == rownames(sample_info)

head(sample_info)
```

# Generate DESeqDataSet object

```{r}
# look up function to use from slides, find help and create an object called dds. countData object, colData object, design formula
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts_table, sample_info, ~replicate + genotype +cell_type)
  
```

## Investigate the dds object 

```{r}
# what does it look like? - e.g. use str(dds)
str(dds)

# how to access counts - can subset dds using [rows,cols], also can check the assys in dds using assays(dds), to get counts out can use assays(dds)$counts
assays(dds)
counts(dds)

# access colData i.e the sample info table. to access a specific columns use colData(dds)$specificcolumn
colData(dds)

# access rowData
rowData(dds)

# access the design
design(dds)

# does it have any rowRanges()? no rowRnages as rowData not added to dds (gene_info)
rowRanges(dds)

# what are its rownames and colnames?
colnames(dds)
rownames(dds)

# what attributes does it have? this pulls out most of the info from above
attributes(dds)

```

## How to subset a DESeqDataSet Object 

```{r}
# practice subsetting dds object
# select first 3 columns
dds[,1:3]

```

# Filter out unexpressed genes 

- It's good practice to filter out genes with 0 counts across all samples at the start 
- This reduces the size of the object and makes computations quicker without affecting the results as these genes are filtered out anyway in the analysis 
- Note that more strict filtering to increase power is automatically applied via independent filtering on the mean of normalized counts within the results function.


```{r}
# filter out genes that have 0 counts across all samples and save as an object called `dds_filtered. This will remove all rows that are equal to 0
dds_filtered_trueorfalse <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >0

dds_filtered <- dds[rowSums(counts(dds))>0,] #this will only keep the rows where the counts are greater than 0

# check dims of dds_filtered  
attributes(dds_filtered)  
  
```

# Perform exploratory analysis on dds_filtered object 

1. transform dds_filtered object using `rlog()` functions
    - name your new variables `rlog_transformed_dds` 
    - we want to set `blind = TRUE` as because we are doing a QC step we do not want the function to take into account the experimental design, we want it to be an unbiased look at how the samples cluster
    - check the class of the rlog_transformed_dds objects 
    - you can look at the tranformed counts table using `assay()` 

NOTE we only use this tranformed data for QC not for downstream analysis or differential expression itself!!


```{r}
#transform data using `rlog()` functions
rlog_transformed_dds <- rlog(dds_filtered, blind=T)

# Notes on `blind` parameter: 
  # blind = TRUE is default
  # blind = TRUE is not the appropriate choice if you expect many or majority of genes to have large differences in counts explainable by   experimental design
  # Mike Love recommends blind = FALSE for visualisation, clustering and machine learning but blind = TRUE for QC
  # Experimental design is only used for calculating the gene-wise dispersion estimates in order to fit a trend line through the dispersions over the mean

  
#check the class of these variable objects 
class(rlog_transformed_dds)
  
#get and look at the tranformed counts table using `assay()`
class(assay(rlog_transformed_dds))

```

# Optional: If you have time do the tranformation again but using the vst() function 

- As a guide 
    - rlog - more robust than VST when size factors vary widely (10x)
    - VST - less sensitive to high count outliers than rlog, quicker - recommended most often 

```{r}
# get vst transformed data using vst() 
vst_transformed_data <- vst(dds_filtered, blind = T)
class(vst_transformed_data)

```


# Now plot heatmap of sample-sample correlations using rlog transformed count data and cor()


```{r}
# get correlation matrix of the rlog_transformed counts matrix to get correlations between samples. Use assay(dds_filtered) to pull out matrix of transformed counts.
corr_dds_spearman <- cor(assay(rlog_transformed_dds), method="spearman")

corr_dds_pearson <- cor(assay(rlog_transformed_dds), 
                        method="pearson")

# use pheatmap to plot the correlation matrix. pheatmap takes a matrix only. Heatmap varies from 0.998 to 1 so heatmap not very informative
pheatmap(corr_dds_pearson)

```

# try ploting a heatmap of sample distances 

```{r}
# get sample distances -> Annotated what this code is doing?
sampleDists <- dist(t(assay(rlog_transformed_dds))) 
sample_distances_matrix <- as.matrix(sampleDists) 

pretty_blue_colors <- colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(9, "Blues")) )(255)

pheatmap(sample_distances_matrix,
         clustering_distance_rows=sampleDists,
         clustering_distance_cols=sampleDists, 
         color = pretty_blue_colors)

#dark blue shows no difference between the 2 samples. This could be due to technical replicates.
```

What do you notice here!? what does it tell us about our data? 

Answer: samples 89 and 88 need to be removed as they are exactly alike



## You can subset a dds object and interact with it like you would a DataFrame

```{r}
# remove the two suspect columns using [,] notation - remove suspicious samples. There are 8 columns and the last 2 columns are 88 and 89.
rlog_transformed_dds_subset <- rlog_transformed_dds[,1:6]

# lets replot the correlation heatmap with the subsetted data - copy code and adjust from above

sampleDists <- dist(t(assay(rlog_transformed_dds_subset))) 
sample_distances_matrix <- as.matrix(sampleDists) 

pretty_blue_colors <- colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(9, "Blues")) )(255)

pheatmap(sample_distances_matrix,
         clustering_distance_rows=sampleDists,
         clustering_distance_cols=sampleDists, 
         color = pretty_blue_colors)

```

What do you notice now about the data and the clustering?


# Now lets use the plotPCA function from DESeq2 to plot PCA of rlog_transformed_data_subset

```{r}
# plot pca of rlog_transformed_dds_subset using plotPCA()
plotPCA(rlog_transformed_dds_subset, intgroup= 'cell_type', ntop=500)

# what does the intgroup parameter do? have a go at changing it...
#it colours the points by the variable specified
plotPCA(rlog_transformed_dds_subset, intgroup= 'replicate', ntop=500)

# how many variable genes is it using for pca? 
#it is using 500 genes

# plot the pca for all genes 
attributes(rlog_transformed_dds_subset)
plotPCA(rlog_transformed_dds_subset, intgroup= 'cell_type', ntop=nrow(rlog_transformed_dds_subset))
```


What does it tell us about our sample?

Answer: variance is mainly due to the two different cell-types - CD4 and CD8


------------- This is the end of our Exploratory data analysis -----------------

We now go back to our original dds object with the raw counts and can update it with anything we need to from the exploratory analysis 
    e.g. - update design with variables in sample info table we want to regress out 
         - remove samples (poor quaility or those with name switches etc)
         
# Revisiting our inital data 

What do we need to do to our data??? 

## Update dds_filtered object if needed - call it dds_filtered_updated

```{r}

# do we need to remove/edit samples? remove samples 88 and 89
dds_filtered_updated <- dds_filtered[,1:6] #remove the 2 samples that are duplicates

# do we want to update the design? Is this nessecary in this case?
# e.g. design(dds) <- ~replicate + condition
design(dds_filtered_updated) <- ~replicate + cell_type 
#genotype removed from the design
attributes(dds_filtered_updated)
```


# Now we can start our actual DE!!!! yay 

Run deseq2 modelling using one function (DESeq())

```{r}

# look at dds slots then run deseq2 function 
# what has happened to your dds slots?
str(dds_filtered_updated)

# run deseq2 modelling on the updated dds object in one function using DEseq() 
dds_filtered_updated_des <- DESeq(dds_filtered_updated)
str(dds_filtered_updated_des)

# then extract the results
results_obj <- results(dds_filtered_updated_des)

# sumarise results 
summary(results_obj)

```

Have a look at the outputs 

# Now we will run the analysis step by step to see whats going on 

## 1. Estimate size factors using estimateSizeFactors()

```{r}
# Calculate the size factors for each sample using estimateSizeFactors()
dds_filtered_updated <- estimateSizeFactors(dds_filtered_updated)

# Access the size factors from the dds_filtered_updated object
sizeFactors(dds_filtered_updated)

# Do you see any systematic differences in size factors between groups? 

```

# Optional: Plot size factors as barchart using ggplot
```{r} 
size_factors <- sizeFactors(dds_filtered_updated)
size_factors <- data.frame(sample = names(size_factors),
                           size_factor = size_factors,
                           sample_group = colData(dds_filtered_updated)$cell_type)

ggplot(size_factors, aes(x = sample, y = size_factor, fill = sample_group)) +
    geom_col() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, h = 1))

```

## Get counts table normalised using size factors

```{r}
# get counts table normalised using size factors - call it normalized_counts

normalized_counts <- counts(dds_filtered_updated, normalized=T)
class(normalized_counts)

# check the class of the output

```

# 3. Estimate dispersions for each gene

```{r}
# Obtain dispersion estimates for each gene using estimateDispersions() 
dds_filtered_updated <-  estimateDispersions(dds_filtered_updated)
dds_filtered_updated

# Plot the per-gene dispersion estimates (DESeq2 has a helper function for this)

plotDispEsts(dds_filtered_updated)
```


## 4. Perform Wald test

```{r}
# Tests for significance of coefficients in a negative binomial GLM, using previously calculated size factors and dispersion estimates and WaldTest

dds_filtered_updated <- nbinomWaldTest(dds_filtered_updated)


```


# So we have the actual steps that we've gone through to get to DE in one place generate the dds object again and use the DESeq() function to perform steps 1-3 in one go

```{r}
# generate dds object (count matrix, columns to factors, exploratory analysis)
dds_actual_analysis <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts_table, sample_info, ~replicate + cell_type)

# filter rows with 0 counts 
dds_actual_analysis <- dds_actual_analysis[rowSums(counts(dds_actual_analysis))>0,] 

# remove unwanted samples 
dds_actual_analysis <- dds_actual_analysis[,1:6] #remove the 2 samples that are duplicates

# run DESeq() 
dds_actual_analysis <- DESeq(dds_actual_analysis)
attributes(dds_actual_analysis)

```

# Get the results from your dds object - call it `results_obj`

```{r}
# What do the results() and summary() do, what arguments can you specify? In contrast define variable, the factor for change and then the baseline (e.g. CD8)
results_obj <- results(dds_actual_analysis, contrast=c('cell_type', 'CD8', 'CD4'), alpha=0.01)

summary(results_obj)

results_obj_df <- as.data.frame(results_obj)

```

# Optional - if we have time: Access the coefficients of the Negative Binomnial GLM – see vingette("DESeq2")
```{r}
head(coef(dds_actual_analysis))
coef_dds <- coef(dds_actual_analysis)
```

# Plot normalised counts for ENSMUSG00000041779
 
 checkout the 'plotCounts()` function
 
```{r}
# Plot normalised counts for gene ENSMUSG00000041779. want to plot counts by cell_type. Need to pull out the 

normalized_counts_actual <- counts(dds_actual_analysis, normalized=T)

genecount <- normalized_counts['ENSMUSG00000041779',] %>%  #pulls out counts for the gene and changes to dataframe for ggplot with switch from rowname to column and column name for counts
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column('sample')
colnames(genecount) <- c('sample', 'count')

genecount <- genecount %>% 
  #adds cell_type column to the dataframe with CD4/CD8 label from the dds object
  mutate('cell_type'=colData(dds_actual_analysis)$cell_type)
genecount

genecount %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=cell_type, y=count))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point()

```

# Access the results table for the comparison between CD8 and CD4 T cells . You can also try to CD4 vs CD8 (i.e. switch the reference) - you could also try this for replicate 1 vs replicate 3 as a control 

checkout `resultsNames()`  & `results()`

```{r}
results_obj_rep <- results(dds_actual_analysis, contrast=c('replicate', '1', '3'), alpha=0.01)

summary(results_obj_rep)

```

Table should contain log2 fold changes and p-values for all genes

# Plot a histogram of the raw and BH-adjusted p-values using ggplot – do they look as expected? for CD8 vs CD4

```{r}
results_obj_df <- as.data.frame(results_obj) #results turned into df for plotting

#results_obj_df <- rownames_to_column(results_obj_df, "gene")
#results_obj_df

results_obj_df %>% #histogram of pvalue vs padj - overlapped
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=pvalue), fill='lightblue') +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=padj), fill='lightgreen')


```

    as.data.frame() %>% 
    ggplot() +

Well done! That is the basics of exploratory data analysis for bulk RNAseq and differential gene expression - these statistical methods underly the foundations for single cell differential expression analysis, although scRNA-seq has a few extra paramterisations and complications to take into account. 

We will now progress to pathway/geneset analysis to get some biological meaning from our DE gene list....
